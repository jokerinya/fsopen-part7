## 7.9: automatic code formatting

In the previous parts we used ESLint to ensure that code to follows the defined
conventions. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is yet another approach for the
same. According to the documentation Prettier is an opinionated code formatter,
that is, Prettier does not only control the code style but it also formats the
code according to the definition.

Prettier is easy to integrate to the code editor, so that when the code is
saved, it is automatically formatted correctly.

Take Prettier to use in your app and configure it to work with your editor.

## 7.10: redux, step1

Refactor the application from using internal React component state to using
Redux for the application's state management.

Change the application's notifications to use Redux at this point of the
exercise set.

## 7.11: redux, step2

Note that this and the next two exercises are quite laborious but incredibly
educational.

is enough that you can see the blogs in the backend and create a new blog.

You are free to manage the state for logging in and creating new blog posts by
using the internal state of React components.
