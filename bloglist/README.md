## 7.9: automatic code formatting

In the previous parts we used ESLint to ensure that code to follows the defined
conventions. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is yet another approach for the
same. According to the documentation Prettier is an opinionated code formatter,
that is, Prettier does not only control the code style but it also formats the
code according to the definition.

Prettier is easy to integrate to the code editor, so that when the code is
saved, it is automatically formatted correctly.

Take Prettier to use in your app and configure it to work with your editor.
